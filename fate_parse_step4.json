But her answer is yes, of course, and so 27-year-old Heidi drives her car with Zyla in the passenger seat to meet Susie -- who Heidi doesn't think she's ever met before. And yet when they arrive, Zyla is delighted to see that Susie really has assembled a memorable room of VIPs in order to impress Heidi, because even Susie can't control everything, along with her security team, minus Dan, who's taking the day off, but Susie is (not?) stylish as ever with extra curls, in contrast to Arlene's Utah curls from last night, but Heidi's subconscious starts to work in overdrive, because something's off. Zy's playing this way too cool, and then Susie invites just Zyla and Heidi to 'walk the beach because I prefer to hydrate there' and yet it's all good after Heidi says yes, again, and again? In private, with ocean sounds... Susie fills up the air with good data about President Fay's position on lesbian marriage -- or, maybe something different but symbolic of that -- and then Zyla's intensity is easing, but Heidi's anxiety is growing. She knows it's on, and then Susie flicks the water and makes strong eye contact before just saying it, 'I was Arlene last night, but we really like you...' while Zyla lets go of Heidi's hand in order to seem less domineering. As Heidi pauses to think, for she's feeling both euphoric and super anxious, but she performs tension at first. She doesn't understand. Naturally, she's dazed and confused just like everyone else who's ever gone ahead, but she also likes this, and now Heidi's making a gradual transition to feeling like she's with, so that Zyla can eventually say 'Yes' too, not sheepishly, and then Susie raises her hands high for a group hug.\"",
